# XATA-Advanced-Fullstack

Welcome to the Teams Management System! This README provides guidelines on how  the on how different endpoints and the components of these project works.
The system is built on:

- 1.**Express Typescript for backend**
- 2.**Jest Library For Testing**
- 3.**HTML for the front-end**
- 4.**Xata database**

These system allows user to create and manage their own teams. Also a team lead can create projects and invite members to participate on the projects. Different tasks are assigned to different users and tracks the progress of the tasks based on the *completion,pending or in-progress state*

## User Authentication and Authorization
These project uses JWT-tokens to authenticate the users and also assign different roles to different users.These feature maximizes the security of the application

Test demostration

1. **user login:**
    On login the users are assigned a unique token which allows then to access and perform different activities on the system  for a given period of time

   **login test**

2. **User Authorization**
    Different users are assigned different  privellages based on their role. For Example the Admin  can view users and delete them but the  user cannot perform these task.
    **Assessing users as unAuthorized user**
    These task is preserved for only admin users hence other users cannot perform these role

     **Assesing users as a authorized users**

## Api Tests
 Used PostMan and Thunder Client  as the *Api End-point* testing tools.These was usefull to ensure that all the apis sent to the Front-end work as required.
 
 Here are some api Tests.
 For the api tests to pass the user must be Logged in first

### user Interface and Results

   1. **Users Display on Admin dashboard:**

   2. **Team Management Page:**

   3. **User management page:**

     ## Database Schema
      The database schema is as shown below
      ![alt text](image.png)

     ## Explanation of the Relationships:
User - Team: Many-to-Many via TeamMembers
User and Team are connected through TeamMembers.
Team - Project: One-to-Many
A single Team can have multiple Projects.
Project - Task: One-to-Many
A single Project can have multiple Tasks.
Task - User: One-to-One
Each Task is assigned to a single User.
Task - Comment: One-to-Many
A single Task can have multiple Comments.
